#### Methods summary: 

[PILOT/COPILOT write a brief summary of the methods underlying the target outcomes written in your own words]

In this paper, Zerr er al. investigate individual differences in adult learning. In Study 1 in particular, N=291 participants from Mechanical Turk learn Lithuanian-English word pairs. The learning stage happened twice over two days. Each day consisted of 16 trials where each trial consisted of only the words the participant did not answer correctly in the trial before, i.e, once the word is correctly answered, it drops from the list. Once the participant answered all 45 words correctly, two distractor tasks were given: math problems and Tetris. At the end of the session on each day, the participant was tested on all 45 words, and the number of words correct was noted. 

------

#### Target outcomes: 

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section for Study 1 "Performance across days".

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Performance across days. The learning curves for
participants on the first day can be found in Figure 2 (top
panel). Here one can see considerable variability in performance
in all three measures (Test 1, tests to criterion,
and final test) across participants, as well as across quartiles
when binned by overall task performance (Fig. 2,
bottom panel).
> 
> For Test 1, after studying the items once, participants
on Day 1 recalled an average of 9.4 English words (SD =
6.6) and on Day 2 an average of 11.1 words (SD = 8.2).
To reach criterion, participants took an average of 8.3
tests (SD = 2.9) on Day 1 and 7.6 tests (SD = 2.8) on
Day 2. The average cued-recall score on the final test
was 33.4 words (SD = 7.9) on Day 1 and 33.2 words
(SD = 8.7) on Day 2. For Day 1, the entire task (including
informed consent, directions, and the 5-min delay)
took an average of 50.3 min to complete (SD = 13.2,
range = 28.8–119.0), whereas Day 2 took an average of
45.7 min (SD = 14.0, range = 26.6–115.3). Additional
descriptive statistics are in Table 1.
> 
> Participants who performed better on the initial test
reached criterion more quickly (i.e., required fewer
tests to criterion) on Day 1, r = −.60, p < .001, 95%
confidence interval (CI) = [−.67, −.52], and Day 2, r =
−.63, p < .001, 95% CI = [−.69, −.55]. Participants who
reached criterion quickly also had better retention of
the word pairs after a delay (i.e., better final-test scores)
on Day 1, r = −.57, p < .001, 95% CI = [−.64, −.49], andDay 2, r = −.48, p < .001, 95% CI = [−.56, −.38]. People
who performed better on the initial test also remembered
 more on the final test on Day 1, r = .26, p < .001,
95% CI = [.15, .37], and Day 2, r = .18, p = .002, 95%
CI = [.07, .29]. As a result of the strong intercorrelations
among the dependent measures (initial test, speed of
learning, and long-term retention), we refer to the task
as the learning-efficiency task from here forward.
> 
> Performance on the learning-efficiency task significantly
 correlated across days for participants (Table 2),
including scores on Test 1, r = .56, p < .001, 95% CI =
[.47, .63], tests to criterion, r = .68, p < .001, 95% CI =
[.61, .73], and final test, r = .68, p < .001, 95% CI = [.61,
.74]. When the three individual measures were converted
to z scores and combined into a single metric
(learning-efficiency score, which is a composite of initial
test, learning speed, and final retention), the correlation
across days was also high, r = .68, p < .001,
95% CI = [.61, .74].

```

# Step 1: Load packages and prepare report object

```{r}
# load packages
library(tidyverse) # for data munging
library(knitr) # for kable table formating
library(haven) # import and export 'SPSS', 'Stata' and 'SAS' Files
library(readxl) # import excel files
library(CARPSreports) # custom report functions
library(readr)
```

```{r}
# Prepare report object. This will be updated automatically by the reproCheck function each time values are compared
reportObject <- data.frame(dummyRow = TRUE, reportedValue = NA, obtainedValue = NA, valueType = NA, percentageError = NA, comparisonOutcome = NA, eyeballCheck = NA)
```

# Step 2: Load data

```{r}
study1_raw_df <- read_csv("data/Study1_LET_N=281_Dataset_osf.csv")
```

# Step 3: Tidy data

The data is best broken down into three dataframes: one for the learning efficiency scores, one for experiment durations, and one for the scores over time.

## Learning Efficiency Scores

```{r}
lescore_names <- c("INITIALTESTSCORE","TESTSTOCRITERION","FINALTESTSCORE")
study1_lescores <- study1_raw_df %>%
  # Manually list the relevant columns.
  select(                                        
    Subject,
    INITIALTESTSCORE_S1, TESTSTOCRITERION_S1, FINALTESTSCORE_S1, LE_Score_S1,
    INITIALTESTSCORE_S2, TESTSTOCRITERION_S2, FINALTESTSCORE_S2, LE_Score_S2
    ) %>%
  
  # One observation per row...
  gather(key="RawColumn", value="Score", -c("Subject")) %>%
  
  # One variable per column...
  extract(RawColumn, c("Measure", "Day"), regex="(.*)_(S1|S2)") %>%
  
  # Handy trick that orders by "time" to match the order of Table 1
  mutate(Measure=fct_relevel(Measure, lescore_names))
```

## Experiment Durations
```{r}
study1_experiment_duration <- study1_raw_df %>%
  # List the relevant columns
  select(Subject, starts_with("Experiment_Length")) %>%
  
  # One observation per row
  gather(key="RawColumn", value="Duration", -c("Subject")) %>%
  
  # Do some renaming of values 
  mutate(Day=str_extract(RawColumn, "A|B")) %>%
  select(-c("RawColumn"))
```

## Scores Over Time
```{r}
study1_words_over_time <- study1_raw_df %>%
  # List the relevant columns. Here, it's all Day 1's tests,
  # and then the Learning Efficiency score.
  select(Subject, INITIALTESTSCORE_S1, matches("TEST\\d+_S1"),
         FINALTESTSCORE_S1, LE_Score_S1) %>%
  
  # Prepare some names for the regex parsing format
  # Final test is test 17 so that it's to the right of all of them.
  rename(TEST1_S1 = INITIALTESTSCORE_S1, TEST17_S1 = FINALTESTSCORE_S1) %>%
  
  # Convert the Learning Efficiency score to a quartile for grouping on the plot.
  mutate(Quartile = ntile(LE_Score_S1, 4)) %>%
  select(-c("LE_Score_S1")) %>%
  
  # One observation per row...
  gather(key="RawColumn", value="Score", -c("Subject", "Quartile")) %>%
  
  # Extract test index from the old column name
  extract("RawColumn", c("Test"), regex="TEST(\\d+)_S1") %>%
  mutate(Test=as.numeric(Test)) %>%
  
  # If there's an NA, assume they've finished 
  replace_na(list(Score=45))
```

# Step 4: Run analysis

### Correlation of learning efficiency across days

First, consider how learning efficiency is computed. 

```{r}
daywise_le <- study1_lescores %>%
  # It is ambiguous in the paper whether it groups by measure, or by measure and day.
  # The numbers match with measure and day, so that is what I assume is used.
  group_by(Measure, Day) %>%
  mutate(zscore = scale(Score)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Score = ifelse(Measure == 'LE_Score', Score, zscore)) %>%
  select(-c("zscore")) %>%
  spread(Measure, Score) %>%
  # It is also unclear whether the z-scores are averaged or summed.
  # The numbers match when they are averaged, so that is what I assume is used.
  mutate("LearningEfficiency" = (INITIALTESTSCORE - TESTSTOCRITERION + FINALTESTSCORE)/3)

# Is this the correct way to compute learning efficiency?
# If this is the case, the table should be full of small values
daywise_le %>%
  group_by(Day) %>%
  mutate("Error" = LearningEfficiency - LE_Score) %>%
  summarize(
    "Mean Error" = mean(Error),
    "Mean Absolute Error" = mean(abs(Error)),
    "Maximum Absolute Error" = max(abs(Error))
  ) %>%
  kable()
```

The table is indeed full of small values, indicating it is quite likely
to have reproduced their method for computing learning efficiency.

> When the three individual measures were converted
to z scores and combined into a single metric
(learning-efficiency score, which is a composite of initial
test, learning speed, and final retention), the correlation
across days was also high, r = .68, p < .001,
95% CI = [.61, .74].

```{r}

daywise_correlation_le <- daywise_le %>%
  select(c(Subject, Day, LearningEfficiency)) %>%
  spread(Day, LearningEfficiency) %>%
  group_by(1) %>%
  do(cor = cor.test(.$S1, .$S2)) %>%
  mutate(
    r = cor$estimate,
    p = cor$p.value,
    "CI Low" = cor$conf.int[1],
    "CI High" = cor$conf.int[2]
  ) %>%
  select(-c(cor, 1)) %>%
  mutate(p=format(p, format='e', digits=3))

daywise_correlation_le %>%
  kable(digits=2)

reproCheck(reportedValue = '.68', obtainedValue = daywise_correlation_le$r[1], valueType='r')
reproCheck(reportedValue = '<.001', obtainedValue = daywise_correlation_le$p[1], valueType='p', eyeballCheck = TRUE)
reproCheck(reportedValue = '.61', obtainedValue = daywise_correlation_le$`CI Low`[1], valueType='ci')
reproCheck(reportedValue = '.74', obtainedValue = daywise_correlation_le$`CI High`[1], valueType='ci')

```

## Graphs

### Figure 2, Top Panel - Learning curves, all participants

> Performance across days. The learning curves for
participants on the first day can be found in Figure 2 (top
panel). Here one can see considerable variability in performance
in all three measures (Test 1, tests to criterion,
and final test) across participants...

```{r}
study1_words_over_time %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Test, y=Score, group = Subject)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = Subject), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=16, linetype="dotted")
```

### Figure 2, Bottom Panel - Learning curves, by quartile

> Here one can see considerable variability in performance
... across quartiles
when binned by overall task performance (Fig. 2,
bottom panel).

The procedure as listed is not clear what "overall task performace" is, but the caption of the figure is more explicit:

> The bottom panel
shows learning curves after participants were placed into quartiles on the basis of their learning-efficiency scores. The

# Step 5: Conclusion

Almost all values were reproducable with little or no trouble. Three values had minor numerical errors, and the computation for the aggregate *learning efficiency* score was underspecified.

## Repeated Rounding

The cause of the minor numerical errors was likely repeated rounding. 
To illustrate this problem, suppose a value is calculated to be 6.1475.
If it is rounded to two decimal places, its value is 6.15.
If that rounded value is rounded again, this time to one decimal place, it becomes 6.2.
This value is different from rounding to one decimal place straightaway, which is 6.1.

This sort of double-rounding is likely to have happened if values are pasted into a manuscript with one rounding (e.g, two decimal places) and then edited in a later revision to only include one decimal place.

### Analysis of Table 1
When this rounding process was applied to all calculated decimal values in Table 1 of the original paper, discrepancies appeared only at the final test score mean of day 1, and the tests to criterion standard deviation of day 1 - exactly the two values which have minor numerical errors in Table 1.

```{r}
# Note that R's 'round' function can't be used for this example, as it always rounds towards the even number.
# It's likely that the authors used the at-half-round-up rule instead.
# Sourced from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12688717/round-up-from-5
round_half_up = function(x, n) {
  return(sign(x)*trunc(abs(x)*10^n + 0.5)/10^n)
}
table1_calculated %>%
  select(Measure, Day, M, SD) %>%
  gather(Statistic, "Calculated", c(M, SD)) %>%
  mutate(
    "Rounded Twice" = Calculated %>% round_half_up(2) %>% round_half_up(1),
    "Rounded Once" = Calculated %>% round_half_up(1),
    "Error" = abs(`Rounded Twice` - `Rounded Once`)
    ) %>%
  mutate(Calculated=round(Calculated, digits=5)) %>%
  mutate_all({function (x) ifelse(.$Error > 0.0, paste("**", x, "**", sep=""), as.character(x))}) %>%
  select(-c("Error")) %>%
  kable()
```

### Analysis of correlation values
This process was also completed for all the correlation values, and the third minor numerical error appears in r-value of the number of tests-to-the-criterion across days.
There is also a fourth entry that is bolded, i.e, it differs when rounded twice vs. rounded once, but the paper's reported value is correct. 

```{r}

all_correlative_values <- initial_to_completion %>%
  mutate("Correlation Group" = "Initial to Completion") %>%
  rename(Subgroup=Day) %>%
  full_join(
    completion_to_retention %>%
      mutate("Correlation Group" = "Completion to Retention") %>%
      rename(Subgroup=Day) %>%
      full_join(
        initial_to_retention %>%
          mutate("Correlation Group" = "Initial to Retention") %>%
          rename(Subgroup=Day) %>%
          full_join(
            daywise_correlation %>%
              mutate("Correlation Group" = "Daywise Correlation") %>%
              rename(Subgroup=Measure) %>%
              full_join(
                daywise_correlation_le %>%
                mutate(
                  "Correlation Group" = "Learning Efficiency Correlation",
                  "Subgroup" = "--"
                )
              )
          )
      )
  )

all_correlative_values %>%
  select(c("Correlation Group", "Subgroup", "r", "CI High", "CI Low")) %>%
  gather(Statistic, Value, c("r", "CI High", "CI Low")) %>%
  mutate(
    "Rounded Twice" = Value %>% round_half_up(3) %>% round_half_up(2),
    "Rounded Once" = Value %>% round_half_up(2),
    "Error" = abs(`Rounded Twice` - `Rounded Once`)
    ) %>%
  mutate(Value=round(Value, digits=5)) %>%
  arrange(`Correlation Group`, `Subgroup`) %>%
  mutate_all({function (x) ifelse(.$Error > 0.0, paste("**", x, "**", sep=""), as.character(x))}) %>%
  select(-c("Error")) %>%
  kable()
```


## Ambiguous definition of *learning efficiency*

The second minor trouble was determining exactly how the *learning efficiency* was calculated. The paper does explain that the z-scores were taken, but it does not specify over what group of data. It is obvious that two different kinds of measures would not be included together, e.g, tests-to-criterion and final test score. It is less clear whether day 1 and day 2's final test scores should be merged. Ultimately this was only decided based upon matching the calculated scores from the authors' data table.

Furthermore, the combination of these z-scores is ambiguous. Two options are plausible: either the learning efficiency score will be a sum or an average of the z-scores of each of the three measures. To be fair, as they differ by a constant factor, most measures - including all correlations that were performed - will not be affected by the difference. Again, by matching with the authors' data table, it was determined that the learning efficiency score was an average.
