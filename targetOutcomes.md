For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section for Study 1 "Performance across days".

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Performance across days. The learning curves forparticipants on the first day can be found in Figure 2 (toppanel). Here one can see considerable variability in performancein all three measures (Test 1, tests to criterion,and final test) across participants, as well as across quartileswhen binned by overall task performance (Fig. 2,bottom panel).For Test 1, after studying the items once, participantson Day 1 recalled an average of 9.4 English words (SD =6.6) and on Day 2 an average of 11.1 words (SD = 8.2).To reach criterion, participants took an average of 8.3tests (SD = 2.9) on Day 1 and 7.6 tests (SD = 2.8) onDay 2. The average cued-recall score on the final testwas 33.4 words (SD = 7.9) on Day 1 and 33.2 words(SD = 8.7) on Day 2. For Day 1, the entire task (includinginformed consent, directions, and the 5-min delay)took an average of 50.3 min to complete (SD = 13.2,range = 28.8–119.0), whereas Day 2 took an average of45.7 min (SD = 14.0, range = 26.6–115.3). Additionaldescriptive statistics are in Table 1.Participants who performed better on the initial testreached criterion more quickly (i.e., required fewertests to criterion) on Day 1, r = −.60, p < .001, 95%confidence interval (CI) = [−.67, −.52], and Day 2, r =−.63, p < .001, 95% CI = [−.69, −.55]. Participants whoreached criterion quickly also had better retention ofthe word pairs after a delay (i.e., better final-test scores)on Day 1, r = −.57, p < .001, 95% CI = [−.64, −.49], andDay 2, r = −.48, p < .001, 95% CI = [−.56, −.38]. Peoplewho performed better on the initial test also remembered more on the final test on Day 1, r = .26, p < .001,95% CI = [.15, .37], and Day 2, r = .18, p = .002, 95%CI = [.07, .29]. As a result of the strong intercorrelationsamong the dependent measures (initial test, speed oflearning, and long-term retention), we refer to the taskas the learning-efficiency task from here forward.Performance on the learning-efficiency task significantly correlated across days for participants (Table 2),including scores on Test 1, r = .56, p < .001, 95% CI =[.47, .63], tests to criterion, r = .68, p < .001, 95% CI =[.61, .73], and final test, r = .68, p < .001, 95% CI = [.61,.74]. When the three individual measures were convertedto z scores and combined into a single metric(learning-efficiency score, which is a composite of initialtest, learning speed, and final retention), the correlationacross days was also high, r = .68, p < .001,95% CI = [.61, .74].
